# Foundations of Cybersecurity
## Module 1 - Stepping Into the Cybersecurity World

I just finished Module 1 of Google’s Cybersecurity Certificate, and while I’ve always had an interest in security, this gave structure and shape to that curiosity.
Forget the Hollywood stuff, black hoodies and blinking green code- this is about **real systems, real risks, and real responsibility**.  
It’s got layers: people, tools, policies, ethics, attackers, and defenders.

## What I learned

### CIA Triad  
No, not the spy agency. It’s the holy trinity of cybersecurity:  
- **Confidentiality** – Only the right people should access the data.  
- **Integrity** – The data shouldn't be changed or messed with.  
- **Availability** – The data and systems should always be usable when needed.
It’s simple but everywhere. I now keep asking: *“Which part of the CIA triad is being protected (or broken) here?

### 💻 Cybersecurity is way more than just hacking (even though that’s all most online course ads talk about.)
There are so many roles! Not just “ethical hackers” but also:

- Security analysts  
- Security engineers  
- Compliance people  
- Even people who write policies and do risk management  

It feels like there's a place for all kinds of minds here, not just coders.

### Threat Actor vs. Threat vs. Vulnerability  
Finally cleared this up:  
- **Threat actor** = who’s coming for you  
- **Threat** = what they’re trying to do  
- **Vulnerability** = what lets them in  
It’s like understanding the difference between a **burglar**, the **robbery**, and the **open window**.

### Security Posture  
It’s like your digital immune system.  
Some companies are rock solid, others are basically on a junk food diet.  
It showed me that **security isn’t just tools, it’s mindset, culture, and discipline**.

---

### Compliance  
Didn’t expect this to be such a big deal.  
Skipping rules like **GDPR** or **HIPAA** can cost companies millions.  
It’s not just “legal stuff”, it’s **accountability**. And it’s part of defense.

## Stuff That Made Me Rethink

### Internal Threats  
I assumed the bad guys are “out there.”  
Turns out, it could be someone **inside** clicking a sketchy link or misconfiguring a system.  
The enemy isn’t always external, sometimes it’s **careless insiders**.

---

### Security Frameworks (NIST, ISO)  
I’ve heard "ISO certified" so many times in marketing.  
Now I know it’s not just a sticker. It’s a **real set of guidelines and standards**.  
Honestly, I feel a lot of companies use the label without living by the framework.

## What I Want to Explore More

### Cloud Security  
Everything I use like Notion, Drive, Email runs on the cloud.  
Learning how those systems can be **secured or attacked** made me want to explore more.  
I want to dive into **how it's configured, permissions, shared folders**.

---

### SIEM Tools  
Just a teaser so far, but the concept of a tool that watches logs and raises alerts?  
That’s exciting.  

---

### Security Careers  
There’s more to this world than just “hackers” or “IT guys.”  
Red teams, blue teams, SOC analysts, forensic investigators, compliance analyst.  
I **don’t know yet where I fit**, but at least I know the terrain now. Hoping real-world projects give me clarity.

---

## My takeaway:  
Cybersecurity = protecting what matters, digitally.  
It's a field that mixes logic, curiosity, and responsibility and honestly, I’m getting more excited with every passing minute.

## Final Thoughts

This first module felt like **trying to untangle a giant knot**, but also kind of thrilling.  
Security isn’t just a skill, it’s a lens. A mindset. A way of looking at things.  
You start noticing the **little cracks** in systems, apps, even your own digital habits.  

For the first time, **tech feels alive** like I’m not just using it, but questioning it.  
Now, I’m noticing things like:  
- What privacy settings apps actually offer  
- How companies respond to breaches  
- What makes a password policy strong or weak  

And honestly? That awareness feels powerful.

## What’s Next
Next up: **Module 2** - diving into the actual threats.  
Malware, phishing, worms, and all the chaotic ways systems get compromised.  

> *Spoiler:* It involves love letters, rogue USB drives, and some wild political motives.  
Let’s go deeper.
