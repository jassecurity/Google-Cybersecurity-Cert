# Course 2 – Module 1  
## “So Who Runs This Place?” — Mapping the Entire Cybersecurity Ecosystem  

This module tells about “What’s the entire security world made of?”_  
And it turns out, there’s a map. A proper one. Not a list of buzzwords, but eight domains that tell you **who’s responsible for what**, **where the risks are**, and **how to keep an entire system (or company) secure from the top down**.

They’re called the **CISSP domains** and together, they frame everything a security professional should care about.  

---

## The Internet Isn't Just One Big Place  

We hear about hackers on the dark web or "leaked PII" without really grasping where all that exists. 

- **Surface Web** is where 99% of us live: Google, Instagram, Wikipedia.  
- **Deep Web** is the gated stuff: password-protected platforms, academic databases, internal systems.  
- **Dark Web** is where anonymity meets crime. You can’t Google it, it runs on encrypted networks like Tor.

Now imagine this messy web holds everything from personal identities to confidential government data. And **each data type carries a different level of risk** if compromised:

- A leaked credit card? That's **financial loss**.  
- A stolen passport scan? That's **identity theft**.  
- A hacked medical system? That’s **reputation damage**, lawsuits, and human lives.

---

### PII vs SPII  
- **PII (Personally Identifiable Information)**: Name, email, phone number, stuff that can identify you.
- **SPII (Sensitive PII)**: Health, financial, biometric data that needs stricter controls due to higher risk.

So how do you keep this world in order? You need structure. And that’s where the **eight CISSP domains** come in, like departments in a highly secure, hyper-functional digital organization.

---

## Domain 1: Security and Risk Management  
**(The Strategy Office of Cybersecurity)**

This is where the rules are written, the ones that say _how much risk can we live with_, _what do we protect first_, and _how do we continue business when things go south_. 
This domain governs **everything** from **compliance laws (GDPR, HIPAA)** to **risk appetite**, **code of ethics**, and **business continuity planning**.  

It’s not about fixing tech, it’s about building policies that align security with **business goals**, and protecting against **financial loss**, **identity breaches**, and **reputation damage**, the three big impacts of risk.

**Why It Matters:**  
This domain ensures that even during a breach, the business can recover, stay compliant, and protect people’s trust.

---

## Domain 2: Asset Security  
**(The Inventory and Labeling Department)**

Once you've defined what matters in Domain 1, Domain 2 is about **classifying, labeling, and securing** it. Data, devices, documents you name it. 
This domain ensures assets are handled based on their **sensitivity and value**, from creation to destruction.

**Why It Matters:**  
If you don’t know what your crown jewels are or where they live, you can’t protect them. This domain brings order to the chaos.


**Domain 1** defines what needs protecting at an organizational level and why, then sets policies.

**Domain 2** handles how those specific assets are treated, stored, and labeled on a day-to-day basis.


---

## Domain 3: Security Architecture and Engineering  
**(The Blueprint and Bricks Team)**

This is the domain where **security is built in**, not bolted on. Focuses on the design and internal structure of systems. 
It asks: Do we have layered security (defense in depth: OWASP principle) built into the architecture?

**Why It Matters:**  
This domain turns abstract policies into actual, defensible systems that are hard to break and easy to maintain.

---

## Domain 4: Communication and Network Security  
**(The Traffic Controller of the Digital Highway)**

Now that systems are in place, how do they talk to each other safely? This domain controls how **data moves**: routers, firewalls, VPNs, TLS, and wireless protections.
It ensures traffic is **authenticated, authorized, and encrypted**.

**Why It Matters:**  
If Domain 3 built the roads, this one manages the intersections and toll booths, making sure bad actors can’t hijack your data mid-transit.

---

## Domain 5: Identity and Access Management (IAM)  
**(The Doorman Who Checks Every ID)**

IAM controls **who** can do **what**, **where**, and **when**. 
It’s not just about passwords, it includes **multi-factor authentication (MFA)**, **biometrics**, **role-based access**, and **privileged access management**.

**Why It Matters:**  
This domain ensures that **access is intentional and auditable** which is often the difference between a mistake and a major breach.

---

## Domain 6: Security Assessment and Testing  
**(The Quality Control Department)**

What good are defenses if they’re never tested? This domain manages **vulnerability assessments**, **penetration tests**, **code reviews**, and **audit reports**. 
It also ensures continuous monitoring and testing against evolving threats.

**Why It Matters:**  
Without testing, security is just a guess. This domain proves whether controls work before attackers do.

---

## Domain 7: Security Operations  
**(The Day-to-Day Cyber Response Team)**

This is where security comes alive. From **incident response**, **monitoring logs**, **forensics**, to **SIEM tools**, this domain executes the strategy in real-time. 
It includes **playbooks**, **chain of custody**, **SOC teams**, and **alert triage**.

**Why It Matters:**  
You can’t prevent everything but you can detect early and respond fast. This domain keeps the organization’s pulse.

---

## Domain 8: Software Development Security  
**(The Developer Who Codes with Security in Mind)**

This domain trains teams to write secure code, avoid common pitfalls like the **OWASP Top 10**, and build **security into SDLC (Secure Development Lifecycle)**. 
It also governs **version control**, **code signing**, and **secure release practices**.

**Why It Matters:**  
Most breaches today start with bad code. This domain ensures the software doesn’t become a soft target.

## Risk Management with NIST RMF

This module also introduced **NIST's Risk Management Framework (RMF)** - a 6-step process that guides how organizations manage cybersecurity risk:

1. **Categorize**: What kind of system/data are we talking about?
2. **Select**: Choose appropriate security controls.
3. **Implement**: Put those controls in place.
4. **Assess**: Test the controls.
5. **Authorize**: Approve the system for use.
6. **Monitor**: Continuously track effectiveness.

It’s not linear, it’s ongoing. Like software updates, your security posture should evolve with your threat landscape.

---

## Final Thoughts: This Isn’t Just Tech, It’s Strategy  

What stood out in this module wasn’t how many tools I’d need to master, it was how **interconnected everything is**. 
Security isn’t one person’s job. It’s a system of specialists working across domains: legal, infrastructure, development, response teams, and executives.

The **NIST Risk Management Framework (RMF)** also made more sense now. It’s not a one-time checklist, it’s a continuous process that every domain plugs into. 

---

## What I’m Taking Forward  

- Understanding the **CISSP domains** gave me a mental map of cybersecurity not just what’s possible, but what’s _needed_.  
- And I finally feel like I’m not just learning random concepts. I’m seeing how **the real-world responsibilities of security pros align with these domains** and how I can grow into one of them.
