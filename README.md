# Google Cybersecurity Certificate: My Personal Learning Journey

Hi, I'm Jaspreet, and this is my raw, honest documentation of everything I'm learning in the **Google Cybersecurity Certificate**.

This isn’t polished or perfect, just raw thoughts, confusions, and whatever clicked (or didn’t) as I go through the course.
I’ve tried to jot down real-life examples and random thoughts that helped me make sense of the concepts.
It’s more like a personal scribble journal than a proper blog. So sorry if it feels messy. But that’s kind of the point.

## Why I'm Doing This

Cybersecurity has been an interest of mine since my undergrad studies, and that curiosity has only grown stronger over time.
While I continue to enjoy working as a web project manager, I’ve also felt a strong pull to understand how things work on the security side.
I’m not just aiming to finish the certificate, I’m here to truly learn, reflect, and explore.

This repo is my open notebook, for myself, and maybe for others figuring it out too.
