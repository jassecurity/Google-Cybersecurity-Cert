## Findings Summary

### Controls Assessment

| Control | Status | Findings |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Least Privilege** | ‚ùå Not in place | All employees have unrestricted access to customer and internal data. No role-based access. |
| **Disaster Recovery Plans** | ‚ùå Not in place | No formal DR plan or backup system exists. |
| **Password Policies** | ‚úÖ In place (**Needs remediation**) | A policy exists, but it lacks minimum complexity requirements (e.g., 8+ characters, alphanumeric, special characters). |
| **Separation of Duties** | ‚ùå Not in place | No formal implementation of duty separation between roles/functions. |
| **Firewall** | ‚úÖ In place | Appropriately configured firewall is active. |
| **Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** | ‚ùå Not in place | No IDS deployed to detect anomalous or malicious activity. |
| **Backups** | ‚ùå Not in place | No automated or scheduled backups of critical data. |
| **Antivirus Software** | ‚úÖ In place | Antivirus is installed and actively monitored by IT. |
| **Legacy System Monitoring** | ‚úÖ In place (**Needs improvement*) | Legacy systems are monitored, but no regular schedule or documented intervention plan exists. |
| **Encryption** | ‚ùå Not in place | Sensitive data including credit card info is stored without encryption. |
| **Password Management System** | ‚ùå Not in place | No centralized password tool. Reset requests handled manually by IT. |
| **Locks (Physical Security)** | ‚úÖ In place | Physical locks are up-to-date and functional. |
| **CCTV Surveillance** | ‚úÖ In place | Surveillance system is functional and operational. |
| **Fire Detection/Prevention** | ‚úÖ In place | Fire detection and suppression systems are present and operational. |

### üìã Compliance Assessment

#### **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**

| Best Practice | Status | Findings |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| Only authorized users have access to credit card data | ‚ùå | Unrestricted employee access violates PCI requirements. |
| Credit card data stored/processed securely | ‚ùå | Credit card data is stored internally without secure protocols. |
| Encryption of credit card transaction data | ‚ùå | No encryption used for cardholder data. |
| Secure password policies | ‚ùå | Current password policy is insufficient; no enforcement or management system. |

#### **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**

| Best Practice | Status | Findings |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| E.U. data kept private and secure | ‚ùå | No encryption or access restriction in place. |
| 72-hour breach notification plan | ‚úÖ | Plan to notify E.U. customers exists and is documented. |
| Data classification and inventory | ‚ùå | Assets are not classified or inventoried. |
| Privacy policies and documentation enforced | ‚úÖ | Internal documentation practices are followed by IT staff. |

#### **SOC 1 / SOC 2 (System and Organization Controls)**

| Best Practice | Status | Findings |
|---------------|--------|----------|
| User access policies in place | ‚ùå | No defined policies around user roles/access. |
| Confidentiality of sensitive data (PII/SPII) | ‚ùå | Data is not encrypted and is accessible to all employees. |
| Data integrity ensured | ‚úÖ | Integrity controls are in place; data is consistent and validated. |
| Availability to authorized individuals | ‚úÖ | Systems are accessible, but too broadly, access controls still lacking. |

## Risk Score: 8/10 ‚Äì High

**Key Risks Identified:**

- High risk of data breaches due to lack of encryption and access controls  
- Potential regulatory fines for non-compliance with PCI DSS and GDPR  
- Lack of disaster recovery planning creates risk of prolonged downtime or data loss

##  Recommendations

### High Priority (Immediate Implementation)

1. **Implement encryption** for all sensitive customer data and credit card transactions.  
2. **Enforce access controls** ‚Äì including least privilege and separation of duties.  
3. **Establish and document a disaster recovery plan** including automated backups.  
4. **Deploy an Intrusion Detection System (IDS)** to monitor for suspicious activity.  
5. **Revise password policy** to meet current complexity standards and implement a password management system.  
6. **Classify and inventory all assets**, including legacy systems.  

### Medium Priority

- Regularize legacy system maintenance schedules.  
- Improve monitoring and alerting mechanisms for system health and activity.

## Conclusion

Botium Toys has a functional IT infrastructure with some security practices in place. However, **critical gaps in data protection, compliance, and business continuity planning significantly elevate their risk profile**. The company should prioritize remediating high-risk areas to align with NIST CSF, PCI DSS, GDPR, and SOC 2 standards.
