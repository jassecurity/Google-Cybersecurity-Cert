# Google Cybersecurity Certificate

## My Personal Learning Journey



Hi, I’m Jaspreet. I’m a Computer Science graduate with experience in both web development and project management. I’ve always had a strong interest in cybersecurity, but never had the chance to explore it in a structured or focused way.

This space is where I’m documenting my journey through the Google Cybersecurity Certificate. It’s not just about completing the modules, but about building a deeper and more practical understanding of security principles, tools, and mindsets.

I’ve tried to jot down real-life examples and random thoughts that helped me make sense of the concepts.
Sometimes it might feel unstructured or messy, but that’s okay. I’m not trying to teach or explain things like an expert, I’m just trying to make sense of it all, one topic at a time.

## Why I'm Doing This


While I’ve enjoyed working as a web project manager, I’m eager to begin my career in cybersecurity.

This certificate is helping me build a strong foundation to make that shift.

I’m not just aiming to finish the certificate, I’m here to truly learn, reflect, and explore.

This repo is my open notebook, for myself and maybe for others figuring it out too.
