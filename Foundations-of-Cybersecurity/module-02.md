## Module 2 – Diving into Cyber Attacks & Human Weakness

Before this module, my mental image of cybersecurity threats was mostly some guy trying to crack passwords. But Module 2 went way beyond that. It exposed me to  the *psychology* behind cyber attacks.

Turns out, the most dangerous thing in the digital world isn’t always code.

It’s trust.

## What I learned

### **Social Engineering Is Terrifying**  
The most dangerous thing online isn’t code. It’s *us*. Social engineering works because people trust, we trust logos, email signatures, uniforms, phone voices, and anything that feels familiar or urgent.  
Attackers weaponize that.

Like the “LoveLetter” virus?  
It wasn’t just malware. It was a *love note* turned digital grenade. 45 million people opened that attachment. Why? Curiosity. Emotion. Human error.

### Malware has types. Flavors. Personalities.

It’s like a criminal underworld with different specialties:

- **Viruses** – Need humans to click. 
- **Worms** – Spread on their own. No need for permission.
- **Ransomware** – Take your files hostage and demand money.
- **Spyware** – Silently watch everything you do without asking.

Each one has a different goal. Some want your money. Some want your data. Some just want chaos.

### Phishing Has Variants

I knew about “Nigerian prince” emails and “lottery wins.” But then I met the cousins:

- **Spear Phishing** – Targeted like a sniper, using your name and role.
- **Whaling** – Aimed at executives like CEO, CFO (big phish = big impact)
- **Smishing/Vishing** – Texts and phone calls pretending to be banks or support teams.
- **BEC (Business Email Compromise)** – Faking your boss and asking you to urgently wire money or share documents.

I now get why companies train employees not to click. It's not paranoia, it's survival.

### Other Social Engineering Attacks (Beyond Phishing)

Here’s the twist: Not all social engineering attacks come via inboxes.

### **Watering Hole Attacks**  
You know how animals gather at a waterhole to drink, and predators just wait nearby instead of chasing them down? That’s exactly how this attack works. They compromise a website you *trust* and wait for you to show up. Once you visit, boom...you’re hit with malware.

### **Baiting**  
They leave infected USB drives in parking lots, hoping you’ll pick one up and plug it in “just to see what's on it.”

### **Physical social engineering**  
They follow someone into a secure office pretending to be staff. A friendly “hold the door” turns into unauthorized access.

## Fascinating Discoveries

### **Morris Worm (1988)**  
One guy tried to count internet-connected computers... and accidentally brought down 10% of the internet by creating a worm that kept reinstalling itself. This led to the creation of **CERTs** (Computer Emergency Response Teams).  
One tiny script. Massive impact.

### **ILOVEYOU Virus (2000)**  
Disguised as a love letter. Spread by emailing itself to your contacts. Infected **45+ million** computers. Caused **$10+ billion** in damage.  
This was *the* social engineering attack that made the world take notice.

### *Brain Virus (1986)**  
Made by two brothers in Pakistan to stop software piracy.  
Problem? It spread through floppy disks worldwide.  
Lesson: Even “good intentions” can cause global chaos.

### **Equifax Breach (2017)**  
147 million people affected, exposed names, SSNs, credit cards. All because someone didn’t patch a known vulnerability.  
This one haunts me. It wasn't a genius hack. It was... laziness.

## What I Want to Explore Next

- **Hacktivism** – Hacking with a cause. Anonymous, WikiLeaks- digital protest or cybercrime? It’s murky but fascinating.

- **Incident Response** – When something breaks, how do teams recover? I want to learn what happens *after* the red alert.

- **Threat Actor Profiles** – Nation-state hackers. Insider threats. APTs (Advanced Persistent Threats). I want to study how these people think.

- **Psychology of Trust Online** – Why do we fall for scams? What makes something “feel” safe when it’s not?

---

## What Stood Out to Me

- **Humans are the weakest link.** Not those end-to-end encrypted chats on WhatsApp. It’s us, clicking weird links, downloading random videos, opening emails that scream “URGENT!”
- **History repeats.** Most modern hacks are old tactics in new outfits.
- **Tiny things = huge damage.** A single USB or unpatched software can cause millions in losses.

## My Honest Thoughts

I used to scroll past news like “Your password was in a breach” alerts.  
Now I stop and think. I ask: *How did it happen? Could it have been prevented?*

I’m just really curious now.
The more I understand how these attacks work, the harder it is to fall for them.
Feels like I’m finally seeing things I used to miss.

## Next Up

On to Module 3: laws, frameworks, and ethics. Now that I know who’s trying to break in, it’s time to learn how to build the wall.

Let’s go.
